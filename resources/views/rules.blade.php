                        <h4>Main rules</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No 'Offer me' nor offering allowed. The host should set fair prices in advance.</li>
                            <li>Don't group buy (split) a bundle before all the games are added, unless all games are announced in advance.</li>
                            <li>Do not resale games on other sites. </li>
                            <li>Do not hi-jack a group buy for your own good. Using an existing thread to organize more group buys is obviously allowed.</li>
                            <li>IndieGala bundles must be send through IndieGala's email system, they can not be given by link.</li>
                            <li>You're responsible when you claim a game in a given thread. If you back out without informing the host or never show up for a reservation, expect at the very least a temp-ban. </li>
                            <li>No claiming multiple copies of the same game/bundles. Other people want that game too. If you want multiple copies of the same game/bundle, give hosting a try. </li>
                            <li>There's a maximum markup for wallet payments of 25%.</li>
                            <li>When hosting, provide how you reach your prices; preferably with tangible numbers rather than a vague algebraic formula. eg; (A+B)/C = X</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Profit rules</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Profit is never allowed, unless you are hosting a higher quantity group buy.</li>
                            <li>It's never allowed to make a profit with a margin of higher than 6%.</li>
                            <li>Recouping the first bundle bought (E.g. Indiegala, Groupees) must be included within the profit margin.</li>
                        </ul>
